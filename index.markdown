I'm a software engineer building a decentralized world. I want to make life simpler and fairer.

I currently work on [Go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum). I focus on rapid improvements to Ethereum scalability. I am thus pursuing three directions: layer 2, consensus algorithms and database format. I am also looking at interfacing Ethereum 1 with Ethereum 2.

My favorite languages are Assembly, Rust, Ruby and Crystal. I use FreeBSD and vim. Other than that, I love improv comedy, space and discussing weird ideas.
